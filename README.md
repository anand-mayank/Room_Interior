# Room_Interior
Room Interior Design based on Computer Graphics using Visual Studio 2010

# Abstract
This project encompasses most of the essential aspects of OpenGL. 
From Drawing 3D graphics to Viewing in Perspective mode to using Input from the keyboard and mouse to interact with the 3D Objects. 
This project displays a basic setup of a Room hence the name of the project Room Interior. The Room has a bed, a table, a chair, a mattress and a fan. The fan is embedded with an animation which can be triggered with Popup menu option to Switch On and Off. The Room can be navigated with the arrow keys ↑ & ↓ along y-axis and w & s along z-axis and a & d along x-axis

# INTRODUCTION
The ‘Room Interior’ is OpenGL software which simulates the depiction of a Room. 
The room has Chair, Table, Mattress, Bed and a Fan. The fan can be switched on and off using Pop up menu. The fan when switched on accelerates the rotation to a maximum speed and when switched of decelerates the rotation to a halt. The user can move forward and backward, left and right, up and down using keys.
The mini project was done to have an idea about Computer graphics using OpenGL. This mini project helped us to understand the concepts behind OpenGL and its programming. It also helped us to implement concepts in our mini project such as translation, drawing objects on the window screen using points, lines, polygon use of lighting effects on the objects this has given us a brief insight as to how programs, involving graphics, are written using OpenGL. 
This mini project was a demonstration to show that OpenGL can be used to implement graphics which can be applied in various fields such advertising industries to endorse company's products animation studios to make animated films, cartoons; gaming industries by displaying use of high-end graphics in designing games; in engineering, architecture, medical fields by creating real-time models for better understanding, clarity and bringing out fresh, new ideas to enhance them.

# ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system.

Design has different connotations in different fields. In some cases the direct construction of
an object is also considered to be design. Design involves problem-solving and creativity. 
A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers.
 # Architecture of Proposed System
 
 Initialize to interact with the windows.

 Initialize the display mode that is double buffer and RGB colour system.

 Initialize window position and window size.

 Initialize and createthe window to display the output.


 # High level and low level design
Step1: Start

Step2: Intro about the keys and mouse

Step3: Select the character with the help of right button in the mouse. The selected character
will get into the boat. Maximum of 2 characters can be selected.

Step4: Press ‘g’ on the keyboard to move the boat from left bank of the river to the right
bank.

Step5: Select the character with the help of right button in the mouse. The selected character
will come out of the boat. Maximum of 2 characters can be selected.

Step6: Press ‘b’ on the keyboard to move the boat from right bank of the river to the left
bank.

Step7: Repeat from step3 until the game ends.


# CONCLUSION
The mini project was done to have an idea about Computer graphics using OpenGL. 
This mini project helped us to understand the concepts behind OpenGL and its programming. 
It also helped us to implement concepts in our mini project such as translation, drawing objects on the window screen using points, lines, polygon use of lighting effects on the objects this has given us a brief insight as to how programs, involving graphics, are written using OpenGL. 
This mini project was a demonstration to show that OpenGL can be used to implement graphics which can be applied in various fields such advertising industries to endorse company's products animation studios to make animated films, cartoons; gaming industries by displaying use of high-end graphics in designing games; in engineering, architecture, medical fields by creating real-time models for better understanding, clarity and bringing out fresh, new ideas to enhance them.

Many improvements can be thought of to this mini project, such as including a background image, use of keyboard interface that provides more flexibility in processing the model as per user requirements. Care was taken to avoid bugs. Bugs may be reported to creator as the need may be. So, we conclude on note that we are looking forward to develop more such projects with an appetite in learning more in computer graphics
